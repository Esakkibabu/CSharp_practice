#  this Keyword in C#

	The “this” keyword in C# is used to refer to the current instance of the class. 
	It is also used to differentiate between the method parameters and class fields if they both have the same name.

	Another usage of “this” keyword is to call another constructor from a constructor in the same class.
	The C# “this” keyword represents the “this” pointer of a class or a stuct.
	The this pointer is a pointer accessible only within the nonstatic methods of a class or struct.
	It points to the object for which the method is called. 
	Static members of a class or struct do not have a this pointer. 
	The this pointer is also used on hidden fields to separate fields with the method parameters with the same names.
